Hi everyone, welcome to our first event together!
Before we start, we would like to say a few opening words.

[slide1]
Last year, Gergely and Peter approached us, to create a great JS conference.
After a few days of planing, we approached the JSConf family with the idea, of a second JSConf in Europe,
located in Budapest, and make it more affordable in the middle-eastern European region.

After a few days full of tension and anxiety of waiting, their answer came, and today we can say, that this event,
[slide2] is based on a conference by Chris Williams, founder and curator of the first JSConf US.

This was in early January 2015. [slide3]
So everything you see here today, is the work of 4 months.  If we missed something,
just come and tell us, lets make this event even greater.

[slide4]
So welcome everybody, on the first JSConf Budapest ever!

[slide5]
We have to say many thanks to those who made this possible.

[slide6]
We thank our two main sponsors Toptal and DoclerLabs, who approached and trusted us even as first timers.
Imagine putting money to an event, which has yet to prove itself.

[slide7]
We thank to those companies, who sponsored their employees to come here and present their ideas. Travis CI, Mozilla,
Spotify, Microsoft, Etsy, Twilio and Futurice was generous in covering the expenses of 7 speakers.

[slide8]
In April we started a program called Diversity Sponsorship. It was aimed to help people from underrepresented groups
in tech, to come to this event with offering free tickets. With this program 11 people are here,
who otherwise could not afford to attend the conference.

[slide9]
Those tickets were paid by these companies and individuals, the Hall of Fame of Diversity Sponsorship: Travis Foundation,
npm Inc, Kitchen Budapest, and Maciej Małecki, Marek Stepien and Bartek Szopka.
They truly just paid in money to help people, they are awesome!

[slide10]
We thank our speakers, who said yes when we approached them, or submitted their talks in our CFP.
They are the reason, that 300 people are here today.

[slide11]
We also thank the companies behind the organizers RisingStack and Ustream, to provide financial background and
handle the video recordings and live stream right now.

[slide 12]
And finally and probably most importantly, we thank You. This event would not be possible without everyone in
this room right now. This is a community driven conference, this is your conference!

We just ask you to help this experience be the awesome for everyone, we have a code of conduct,
just be nice to each other.

[slide 13]
If you have any questions, need assistance, have to tell us something, we’re here to help you.
You can find anyone in these nice bright yellow shirts, you can turn to them, and they’ll help.

[slide 14]
On Twitter we’re watching this hashtag, or you can send us direct messages if necessary.
During the talks you can ask your questions using this hashtag, and they will be answered in the Q&A session after the talks.

[slide15]
As you guessed, we’re not the best speakers to handle the whole conference,
so without further delay, we present you the MC of this years event:
